# GameBoy-Horror-executables
This Repository contains the executable file for both a colour and DMG version of my GameBoy Horror App that I created to show case my GameBoy Horror replica.

# How to run the files

Download the desired executable (dmgHorror or colorHorror) and flash to a gameboy flash cartrage.
